      <h2>Background</h2>
      <div id="paragraph1"><p>Scott Ramon Seguro Mescudi (born January 30, 1984), better known by his stage name Kid Cudi,
        is an American rapper, singer, songwriter, record producer, and actor. He has widely been recognized as an influence on several contemporary hip hop and alternative acts.
        His lyrics are often autobiographical and describe his childhood hardships of depression, loneliness and alienation,
        his struggle with alcohol and  drugs into adulthood, as well as themes of heartbreak, dissipation and celebration.
        Cudi began to gain major recognition following the release of his first official full-length project,
        a mixtape titled A Kid Named Cudi (2008), which caught the attention of American musician Kanye West,
        who subsequently signed Cudi to his GOOD Music label imprint by late 2008.</p></div>

      <h2>Popular Works</h2>
      <div id="paragraph3"><p>More than a decade after “Day ‘n’ Nite” reached No. 3 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, Cudi, 37, is still laughing.
        His 2009 double platinum album, “Man on the Moon: The End of Day,” is widely credited with setting the stage for what’s become known as emo rap,
        a hip-hop subgenre that features a varied sonic palette and a ceaseless outpouring of emotion and vulnerability.
        Years later, Cudi’s DNA can be spotted in everyone from the late Lil Peep and Juice WRLD to Lil Uzi Vert, Trippie Redd, Travis Scott and Princess Nokia.</p></div>
